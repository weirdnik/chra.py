This is a turnkey script to set-up a VPN server compatible with builtin VPN clients avaliable on most modern operating
systems. It works with:

* Mac OS X / macOS

This script is based on setup descibed in Debian Wiki Android VPN Server HOWTO: https://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/AndroidVPNServer with one minor extension.

## The name

In Polish "chrapy" is a word for submarine's snorkel that allows the sub to hide underwater while maintaining connection
 with the surface for air access, just like VPN hides you from the Internet while you can still access it.

## Requirements

A Debian-based Linux system with root and kernel access (a VPS is OK, shared-kernel hosting is not).

## Usage

    chra.py <magic network number> <username 1> [<username 2> â€¦ <username *n*>]
